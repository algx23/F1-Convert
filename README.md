# F1 Convert

---

This is an application which will convert your dry F1 Game setups to wet setups!

**:information_source: It is always better to have dedicated wet and dry setups (functionality for this is planned!). But, if you need a quick setup, this should provide a good baseline you can use, and tweak to your liking**

## In the works

:warning: The time scale for these features is unknown. I will try push them out as regularly as I can.

There are some features which I am considering developing, to take this from a simple F1 Game Setup Converter to a full companion.

These include:

- Making the UI better (it is very basic right now)
- More F1 Games, (F1 25 will be next, then I will work back)
- Track guides for many different tracks
- Telemetry analysis and presentation (timescale unknown)
